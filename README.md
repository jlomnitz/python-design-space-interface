Design Space Toolbox V2 (Python Interface)
==============================================

This is part of the Design Space Toolbox V2 project, a software implementation of the System Design Space method developed by Jason G. Lomnitz, originally developed in the laboratory of Michael A. Savageau (for examples of this methodology, see [1-6]). This method decomposes complex nonlinear systems into a finite number of tractable nonlinear subsystems.

Getting Started
---------------------

To use the Design Space Toolbox V2 from Python, you must have Python 2.7.x, as well as a working version of the **Design Space Toolbox V2 C Library** (an open-source library to be released in 2015). Access to the Design Space Toolbox V2 C Library available upon request by contacting Jason G. Lomnitz (jlomn@ucdavis.edu). In addition, plot generation and data visualization depends on the NumPy (www.numpy.org), Scipy (www.scipy.org) and Matplotlib (www.matplotlib.org) packages.

The preferred installation process is
