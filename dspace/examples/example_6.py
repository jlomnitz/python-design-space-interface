# Design Space Example 6
##########################
# This example is similar to previous examples, but demonstrates the analysis
# of systems with cycles. A cycle that is dominant creates singularity in 
# conventional design space analysis.  These singularities are resolved 
# automatically by assuming subdominant fluxes.

## Import package with basic functionality
# The initial step in running the design space toolbox is importing the base
# package, and in this case the plotting functionality.
#
# Importing the plotting utilities subpackage adds plotting functions to objects
# object that are often of interest. We must also import the plotting library,
# and w make plotting interactive.

import dspace
import dspace.plotutils
from math import *
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
matplotlib.interactive(True)

## Enter Equations
# The following system has three dependent variables and two independent
# variables.  Ultimately, the design space will vary over the two
# independent variables X3 and X4 and two parameters, alpha and beta.
#
# dX1/dt =          alpha*X5 + X4 - X1
# dX2/dt = X1 - X2 - X2*X6 - beta*X2^2
# dX3/dt =                     X2 - X3
# dX4/dt =             X3 + X2*X6 - X4
#
# Here, the system is input, parsed, and analyzed.
# The equations and dependent variables are entered as strings.

f = ['X1. = alpha*X5 + 2*X4 - 2*X1^2', 
     'X2. = X1^2 - X2 - X2*X6 - beta*X2^2',
     'X3. = X2 - X3',
     'X4. = X3 + X2*X6 - X4 ']

# The next step is to construct an Equations object using this list of strings.

eq = dspace.Equations(f)

## Construct the System Design Space - with and without resolving cycles.
# The previous system of equations can be analyzed using system design space.
# First, we will define a system design space in the way we have defined it
# in the previous examples, without resolving any cycles.

ds_nocycles = dspace.DesignSpace(eq, name='Without Cycles')

# Then, we will resolve the cycles in a second design space object and we will 
# compare it with the design space where the cycles are not resolved. To resolve
# cycles, the design space is constructed with the 'resolve_cycles=true' 
# keyword argument.

ds_cycles = dspace.DesignSpace(eq, resolve_cycles=True, name='With Cycles')

## Test for Validity
# We calculate the valid cases without and with resolving cycles. As we can see
# the valid cases are not the same for the two methods.  The set of valid cases
# for the design space without resolving cycles is a subset of those found when
# resolving cycles. 

valid_no_cycles = ds_nocycles.valid_cases()
valid_cycles = ds_cycles.valid_cases()

print 'All valid cases without resolving cycles: ' + str(valid_no_cycles)
print 'All valid cases with resolving cycles: ' + str(valid_cycles)

print 'Is subset: ' + str(set(valid_no_cycles).issubset(set(valid_cycles)))

## Cyclical cases
# The additional cases in the design space with resolving cycles are cases
# where the dominant terms create an underdetermined system that does not have
# a solution. These singular cases are resolved by including subdominant 
# processes. For each cyclical case there may be a number of dominant subcases.

# We first determine the cases that are cyclical by iterating over all the valid
# cases.

for case in ds_cycles(valid_cycles):
    print str(case.case_number)+':'+case.signature+ ' cyclical? ' + str(case.is_cyclical)

# A cyclical case is similar to a design space in that it has subcases. Of these
# subcases not all of them are valid and we can determine the subcases that are
# valid.

valid_subcases = ['7_'+ str(i) for i in ds_cycles(7).valid_subcases()]
valid_subcases += ['10_'+ str(i) for i in ds_cycles(10).valid_subcases()]

print valid_subcases

# A subcase can be obtained from the case object similar to how a case is 
# obtained from a design space.

case10 = ds_cycles(10)
case10_6 =  case10(6)

# Subcases can be obtained directly from the design space object, by passing 
# a string with the following format: 
#    <case number>_<subcase number>

case10_6 = ds_cycles('10_6')

# A subcase is an instance of the Case class and thus all methods that are
# available for a case is available to a subcase. As an example, we will obtain
# a parameter set that makes Case 7 Subcase 6 the dominant case.

pvals = case10_6.valid_parameter_set
print pvals

## Cyclical subcases
# When resolving a cyclical case with subdominant fluxes, it is possible to 
# create a new cycle that again must be resolved. The current implementation 
# does not solve all possible subcycles [under development], but can solve some.
# This is the case for Case 7 subcase 3. We inspect the equations of the subcase
# to identify the cycle directly.

case10_3 = ds_cycles('10_3')

print case10_3.name + ' is cyclical? ' + str(case10_3.is_cyclical)
for equation in case10_3.equations:
    print equation

# There is a new cycle between the equation for X2 and the equation for X3.
# we can print the valid subcases for case 10 subcase 3 much in the same way
# we found and printed the valid subcases for case 10.

print  ['10_3_'+i for i in case10_3.valid_subcases()]

# A more convenient way to obtain all the subcases, and their subcases, is to
# pass a list of cases and remove all the cyclical cases and replacing them 
# with their respective subcases.

print ds_cycles.cycles_to_subcases(valid_cycles)

## All valid cases by resolving cycles.
# The list of cases obtained by expanding the cycles includes both valid
# and invalid subcases. It is more often useful to restrict the list of 
# cases and subcases to those that are valid. A list of all valid cases and
# expanding this list to all valid subcases is obtained using the 'valid_cases'
# method for the design space object.

print ds_cycles.valid_cases(expand_cycles=True)

# The list of cases and subcases bounded in parameter space may also be
# obtained.

print ds_cycles.valid_cases(expand_cycles=True, p_bounds={'alpha':100,
                                                           'beta':1e-1,
